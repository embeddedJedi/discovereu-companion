# Data Sources & Attribution

## Emergency numbers (2026-04-13)

- **EU 112 country pages** — `https://112.eu/en/countries/` — primary source for the general, police, ambulance, and fire numbers across all EU + EEA members in `data/emergency-numbers.json`. Each country block cites its specific 112.eu sub-page.
- **National interior ministries & police portals** — cross-checked per country (e.g. `bmi.gv.at`, `police.hu`, `policia.es`, `poliziadistato.it`, `politiet.no`, `politie.nl`, `polisen.se`, `psp.pt`, `egm.gov.tr`). Used to confirm short-code legacy numbers and tourist-police lines.
- **ILGA-Europe country pages** — `https://www.ilga-europe.org/` — only authoritative source consulted for `lgbtqiSafeLine` fields. Where no ILGA-recognised helpline exists the field is `null` by policy (a wrong number is worse than none). Currently populated only for IE (LGBT Ireland) and IT (Gay Help Line / Gay Center Rome).
- **Turkish Ministry of Interior + e-Devlet** — `icisleri.gov.tr`, `turkiye.gov.tr` — confirmed the 2021 consolidation of emergency lines under 112 and the Istanbul Tourist Police desk number.
- Refresh cadence: annually, or immediately on any publicly-announced number change. Contributors invited via GitHub issue to flag stale entries.

## Sub-project 2 sources (2026-04-12)

- **Wikivoyage** (CC BY-SA 3.0) — `https://en.wikivoyage.org/` — country + city guide text for `data/guides.json`. Attribution preserved in each entry's `sourceUrl` field. Refreshed annually.

- **VFS Global / iDATA / TLScontact / BLS** — consulate application centre addresses in Turkiye for `data/tr-consulates.json`. Sourced from each provider's public Turkiye portal; providers occasionally change contracts so refresh quarterly.

## Core data sources (2026-04-10)

- **Natural Earth** (public domain) — `https://www.naturalearthdata.com/` — 1:50m country boundaries for `data/geojson/europe.geojson`. Simplified to 36 European features.
- **Kaggle Cost of Living** — `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/` — per-country cost indices informing `data/countries.json` `costPerDay` fields.
- **Seat61** — `https://www.seat61.com/` — train route and mandatory reservation data for `data/trains.json` and `data/reservations.json`.

## TR missions (2026-04-13)

- **Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Foreign Affairs — Representations index** — `https://www.mfa.gov.tr/representations.en.mfa` — authoritative list of TR embassies, consulate-generals, and honorary consulates worldwide. Primary source for `data/tr-missions.json`.
- **Per-mission mfa.gov.tr subdomains** — each TR mission publishes its own site under the pattern `<city>.be.mfa.gov.tr` (embassies), `<city>.bk.mfa.gov.tr` (consulate-generals), and `<city>.emb.mfa.gov.tr` (some embassies) — used for address, phone, email, and working hours of each entry.
- Honorary consulates (IS, LI, LU, MT) have limited consular capacity; TR citizens in those countries are typically served by the nearest resident embassy as noted in each entry's `notes` field.
- Cyprus: TR maintains diplomatic representation in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (Lefkoşa) and does not operate a mission in the Republic of Cyprus; this is noted in the CY entry.
- Refresh cadence: quarterly, or immediately on any publicly-announced change. `emergencyPhone` fields are null pending per-mission verification — most missions publish a 24/7 nöbetçi memur line on their site and these will be filled in a follow-up pass.

## Embassy lookup patterns (2026-04-13)

Source data for `data/embassy-lookup-pattern.json` — every `mfaUrl`, `embassyListUrl`, and `emergencyPhone` was verified against the issuing government's official foreign-affairs portal on 2026-04-13.

- **Liechtenstein** — consular representation is provided by Switzerland abroad under the 1919 Liechtenstein-Switzerland Customs and Representation Treaty; both numbers documented.
- Refresh cadence: annually, or immediately when a user issue reports a dead URL. Contributors invited via GitHub issue.

## Impact public dataset (2026-04-13)

- **Internal aggregation** — no external sources. `data/impact-public.json` is produced by the Node freeze script (`scripts/freeze-impact.mjs`, Task 8) from user-contributed trip summaries merged via GitHub PR. The anonymization pipeline (k-anonymity threshold k=5) is defined in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-13-impact-dashboard-design.md` and implemented in `js/impact-anonymize.js`.
- **License** — CC-BY-4.0 applies **only** to `data/impact-public.json`; the rest of `/data/` retains upstream licenses documented elsewhere in this file. Full terms: `data/LICENSE-impact-public.md`.
- **Seed state** — the committed seed file has `inputCount: 0` and zeroed aggregates. It is rewritten in place by the freeze script once contribution PRs are merged.
- Refresh cadence: on-demand, after each batch of merged contribution PRs.

## Green hostels (2026-04-13)

Source data for `data/green-hostels.json` — curated seed of certified-green hostels across DiscoverEU cities. Every non-placeholder entry was cross-checked against a publicly cited source (the hostel operator's own page documenting certification, the certification body's country news feed, or an official national partner directory). Entries flagged `verify: true` are placeholders for cities where no specific hostel could be confirmed from the cert body's public directory at seed time — these must be validated or removed before launch.

- **Green Key International — global directory and country pages** — `https://www.greenkey.global/green-key-sites` — authoritative list of Green Key awarded sites worldwide.
- **Green Key Denmark directory** — `https://www.greenkey.dk/en/map-details/steel-house-copenhagen` — source for Steel House Copenhagen's Green Key status.
- **Green Key France (La Clef Verte)** — `https://www.laclefverte.org/` — national equivalent in France; cross-referenced via `https://www.mije.com/en/youth-hostel-in-paris/the-green-key-label-of-the-mije-fauconnier-hostel` and `https://www.hifrance.org/en/about-us/the-labels/green-key/`.
- **EU Ecolabel — Tourist accommodation product group** — `https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/circular-economy/eu-ecolabel_en` — official EU Ecolabel hotel/hostel registry.

**Refresh cadence:** `verifiedAt` must be refreshed quarterly. Every certification is valid for 12 months and must be renewed by the property annually; a quarterly curator pass catches lapses. Contributors invited via GitHub issue to flag stale entries or propose new verified hostels (PR must include a sourceUrl pointing to the issuing body's public record).

## Buddy-matching cities (2026-04-13)

- **`data/buddy-cities.json`** — editorial seed of the 20 highest-traffic DiscoverEU destinations (per European Commission participant statistics) to bootstrap the buddy-matching feature. Cities: Paris, Berlin, Madrid, Rome, Barcelona, Amsterdam, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Lisbon, Athens, Krakow, Warsaw, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Dublin, Brussels, Munich, Milan, İstanbul.
- **Coordinates** — İstanbul coordinates cross-referenced with the `cities[]` block in `data/countries.json`. The other 19 cities are not present in `countries.json` cities arrays (only Türkiye lists sub-cities), so lat/lng values were taken from publicly verified Wikipedia / OpenStreetMap canonical city centroids. No coordinates fabricated.
- **Issue routing** — each city maps to a GitHub label `buddy-{cityId}`. Maintainer curates the sticky issue per city post-launch, then updates the corresponding `issueNumber` and flips `active` to `true` in a follow-up PR (see plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-13-buddy-matching.md` §Maintainer curation).
- Refresh cadence: reviewed each time DiscoverEU publishes updated participant travel stats (roughly annually).
